# MSL-LoadLib

This package loads a shared library in Python. It is basically just a thin wrapper around [ctypes][]{:target="_blank"} (for libraries that use the `__cdecl` or `__stdcall` calling convention), [Python for .NET](https://pythonnet.github.io/){:target="_blank"} (for libraries that use Microsoft .NET, `CLR`), [Py4J](https://www.py4j.org/){:target="_blank"} (for Java `.jar` or `.class` files) and [comtypes](https://comtypes.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html){:target="_blank"} (for libraries that use the [Component Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model){:target="_blank"} or [ActiveX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX){:target="_blank"}).

However, the primary advantage is that it is possible to communicate with a 32-bit shared library in 64-bit Python. For various reasons, mainly to do with the differences in pointer sizes, it is not possible to load a 32-bit shared library (e.g., .dll, .so, .dylib files) in a 64-bit process, and vice versa. This package contains a [Server32][msl.loadlib.server32.Server32] class that hosts a 32-bit library and a [Client64][msl.loadlib.client64.Client64] class that sends requests to the server to communicate with the 32-bit library as a form of [inter-process communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication){:target="_blank"}.
