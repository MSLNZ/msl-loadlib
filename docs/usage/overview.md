# Overview

There are two ways to load a library

1. [Directly][direct] load a 64-bit library in 64-bit Python (or a 32-bit library in 32-bit Python)
2. Use a [Client-Server][client-server] implementation to communicate with a 32-bit library from 64-bit Python. You may also create a [custom server][refreeze].
