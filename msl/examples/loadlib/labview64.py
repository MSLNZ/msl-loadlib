"""
Communicates with :ref:`labview_lib32 <labview-lib>` via the :class:`~.labview32.Labview32` class.

.. attention::
   This example requires that the appropriate
   `LabVIEW Run-Time Engine <https://www.ni.com/download/labview-run-time-engine-2015/5507/en/>`_ is installed
   and that the operating system is Windows.

Example of a module that can be executed within a 64-bit Python interpreter which can
communicate with a 32-bit library, :ref:`labview_lib32 <labview-lib>`, that is hosted
by a 32-bit Python server, :mod:`.labview32`. A 64-bit process cannot load a
32-bit library and therefore `inter-process communication <ipc_>`_ is used to
interact with a 32-bit library from a 64-bit process.

:class:`~.labview64.Labview64` is the 64-bit client and :class:`~.labview32.Labview32`
is the 32-bit server for `inter-process communication <ipc_>`_.
